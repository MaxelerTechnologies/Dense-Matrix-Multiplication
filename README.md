### Description
A matrix is dense if most of its elements are non-zero. Multiplication involves a dot product between every row of a matrix against every column of another matrix. This leads to O(N^3) compute with only O(N^2) data. Since compute costs dominate over data transfer costs, this is ideal for DFE acceleration.
